{name:"Theta Chi", location:"210 Langdon Street",history:"Theta Chi was founded 
on April 10, 1856, at Norwich University in Norwich, Vermont, by two military 
cadets, Frederick Norton Freeman and Arthur Chase. A third man, Egbert Phelps, 
is considered to be the \"assistant founder\" for lending his help and advice to 
Freeman and Chase after transferring to Union College in 1854 (he was a member 
of the Chi Psi Fraternity). The first initiates after the founders were Edward 
Bancroft Williston and Lorenzo Potter. Theta Chi's early history is closely 
connected to the history of Norwich University. In 1866 a massive fire 
devastated the University, completely destroying the Old South Barracks, 
where the Fraternity had been founded. This disaster prompted the University 
to move from Norwich, Vermont to its present location in Northfield, Vermont. 
During fall quarter in 1881, Norwich University was reduced to only 12 students 
and Theta Chi's membership was reduced to one undergraduate member, James M. 
Holland. In November of that year, Phil S. Randall and Henry B. Hersey 
approached Holland and insisted that they be allowed to join Theta Chi; 
Holland agreed, thus saving the Fraternity from extinction.",
